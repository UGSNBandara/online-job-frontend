## üíª **TECHNOLOGIES USED** (1 minute)

### **Frontend Stack:**
- **React 18** - Modern UI library with hooks and functional components
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast development build tool (replacement for Create React App)
- **Material-UI (MUI)** - Google's Material Design component library for professional UI
- **React Router DOM v6** - Client-side routing for Single Page Application
- **Axios** - HTTP client for API communication
- **Styled Components** - CSS-in-JS for custom component styling

### **State Management:**
- **React Context API** - Global state management for authentication and messaging
  - *Usage: AuthContext manages user login state, profile data, and authentication status across all components*
  - *Usage: MessageContext handles chat functionality, selected conversations, and real-time messaging state*
  - *Benefits: Eliminates prop drilling, provides centralized state, easy to test and maintain*
  
- **React Hooks** - useState, useEffect, useContext for local component state
  - *useState: Managing form inputs, modal visibility, loading states, and component-specific data*
  - *useEffect: API calls, event listeners, cleanup functions, and side effects management*
  - *useContext: Accessing global state from AuthContext and MessageContext throughout components*
  - *Custom Hooks: useAuth() and useMessage() for cleaner component code and reusability*

### **Development Tools:**
- **ESLint** - Code quality and consistency
- **Modern JavaScript (ES6+)** - Arrow functions, destructuring, async/await
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach
